		<p>The morning sun bathes the grey peaks of the Nordkette in a golden light. A sight that brings a sparkle to the eyes of visitors and locals alike. In Innsbruck, the mountains are our constant companions, even when we are standing at the heart of the city. They surround us on all sides and we are always stealing glances at them â€“ capturing the essence of a holiday while at work, on a walk through the city, from classroom windows or during a hike, bike ride or ski day. Innsbruck is more: more than just a city, more than the mountains and more than a simple holiday destination. Innsbruck is an alpine-urban experience.The <b>tours and travels</b> region is much more than its city alone. It also includes 40 towns and villages that fulfil your every want and need. You can stay in the alpine countryside, in an idyllic village, in the city centre or at 2,000 metres above sea level. On the Mieming Plateau west of Innsbruck, for example. This sunny area lies on a high mountain plateau with green alpine meadows and secluded groves. It is ideal for golf, leisurely cycling, walking and cross-country skiing.</p>
